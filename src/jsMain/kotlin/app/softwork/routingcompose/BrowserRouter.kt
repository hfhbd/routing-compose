/**
 * A router leveraging the History API (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History).
 *
 * Using a BrowserRouter requires you to implement a catch-all to send the same resource for
 * every path the router intends to control. BrowserRouter will handle the proper child composition.
 *
 * Without a catch-all rule, will get a 404 or "Cannot GET /path" error each time you refresh or
 * request a specific path. Each server's implementation of a catch-all will be different and you
 * should handle this based on the webserver environment you're running.
 *
 * For more information about this catch-all, check your webserver implementation's specific
 * instructions. For development environments, see the RoutingCompose Readme
 * for full instructions.
